Price Segmentation is a price given to different segment. The key idea in this concept is the </b>segmentation</b>.

In this exercise, we segment the customers (companies) and transaction. Since the dataset is specific for 1 product family, we do not segment the product. We also the minimum segment mumbers to 3. So the final product, we should at least have 9 segmentation (3 segments from customers x 3 segments from transaction).
